					<span class="font-semibold"><u>Initiatives </u></span></h4>Very few livelihood based farmer/people owned institutions have achieved profitability and scale in the past.  Agriculture sector has a long value chain with limited benefits reaching at the farmer level. Along with that it is becoming risky and unprofitable day by day thus shifting household priority from considering it as a primary source of livelihood to alternate source of livelihood.  <br><br>
Government has recently pushed for a new initiative where farmer/primary producers are mobilized into groups (Farmer Producer Organization) and their capacities are build to work collectively as a for profit company and compete in global market.<br><br>
We strongly believe that it can’t be achieved without using an advance management information system that can keep all data centralized and produce business insights for the FPO to have a competitive edge in the market.<br><br>
We are developing first cloud based comprehensive and customizable MIS tailored for FPO’s. This product integrates a web-based portal, a mobile app, Cloud Telephony, SMS, and Biometric devices to create an MIS that will allow FPO management/governors/promoter(s)/financer(s) to monitor FPO progress and impact, manage end-to-end operations and logistics, sales and expenditure tracking, Accounting and HR Management, Record and Book keeping, Company related information and Shareholder Information. <br><br>
New to FPO as a concept. Read <a href="http://sfacindia.com/Krishidoot.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nabard.org/english/Financing.aspx">here</a>    <br><br>
